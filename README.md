# Group-35-Big-data-analytics

Dear Professor Khalfallah,

We are group 35 called The Dreamers, we worked on Data Science Bookcamp Case Study 2.

We tried our best to put all the material on the main branch, but our screencast file is too big. So the solution was to put our project material in the "Releases" tab which is on the right â†’

And unfortunately, a member of our group left us (changed school) during the semester, which is why we carried out the project with two of us.

Best regards,
Linda DAI and Mantia SISSOKO
